# codeRefactor
Looked at the html and css folders to refactor them into more accurate pages. I added a title to the website so that it sticks out more from other sites. We also put alt tags on all the image links so that the code was accurate and changed many div tags to symantic elements. The client was a marketing firm that follows accessibility standards and they wanted their site to optimized with search engines.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
